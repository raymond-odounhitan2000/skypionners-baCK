## üì¢ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, report it responsibly using one of these methods:

- Email: [security@yourdomain.com]  
- GitHub Security Advisory (if enabled on this repo)

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability.  
- Steps to reproduce the issue.  
- Potential impact if known.  
- Suggested fixes or workarounds (if any).

## üîë Security Best Practices for Contributors

To help keep this project secure, please:

- Avoid committing secrets, API keys, or credentials.  
- Use environment variables for sensitive configurations.  
- Keep dependencies up to date.  
- Run security scans (e.g., `npm audit`, `trivy`, `bandit`, `snyk`) before PR submission.  
- Report suspicious behavior immediately.

## ‚öôÔ∏è DevSecOps Workflow

We integrate security into every step of our DevOps pipeline:

### 1. **Code Security**
- Run **linters** and **static analysis tools** (e.g., ESLint, Bandit, SonarQube).  
- Use **pre-commit hooks** to block commits with secrets (e.g., `git-secrets`, `pre-commit`).  
- Enforce code reviews before merging.

### 2. **Dependency Security**
- Run dependency checks (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `snyk`).  
- Keep libraries and frameworks up to date.  
- Use lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`) for reproducibility.

### 3. **Container & Infrastructure Security**
- Scan Docker images with **Trivy** or **Grype**.  
- Use minimal base images (`alpine`, `distroless`).  
- Apply least privilege to containers (no root user).  
- Run **Kubernetes admission controllers** to enforce security policies.

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- Automate security scans in GitHub Actions/GitLab CI.  
- Block merges if vulnerabilities are detected.  
- Use signed commits and verified builds.  
- Store secrets in **GitHub Actions Secrets** or a vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

### 5. **Runtime Security**
- Enable monitoring with tools like **Falco** or **Prometheus**.  
- Set up logging & alerting for suspicious activity.  
- Regularly rotate keys and tokens.  
- Apply zero-trust principles where possible.

## ‚úÖ Our Commitment

We take security issues seriously and will:

- Review all vulnerability reports promptly.  
- Provide acknowledgment to reporters.  
- Work on a fix and release updates as quickly as possible.  
- Communicate transparently about the resolution.  

Thank you for helping us keep this project safe for everyone üöÄ
